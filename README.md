- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Martin Bojinov. This Github serves as a collection of many of my projects. Some projects are private and availabe upon request due to institution policies.
- I tend to work on my projects offline and post them in batches here.
- You can find me @ linkedin.com/in/martin-bojinov/

I'll slowly be populating this page with more of my projects so look out for more projects to come.
